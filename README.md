# GAN-Face-Generation
This is Project 5 of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree (Fall 2019). 

The objective of this project was to train a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network using a set of faces. 

Ultimately we would like to generate realistic looking faces. 

Sometimes the generated faces can be quite terrifying so users be warned.
